Deshmukh has not come alone to meet me at Amalner, a town near the central Maharashtra 
city of Jalgaon. After hearing that someone from Bengaluru had come to meet people who 
know Premji, he has brought his son and grandson along, too. Deshmukh used to work as a 
machine operator in Wipro’s Amalner factory, and did so for over four decades. He used to 
fill vegetable oil in packets that would get shipped to wholesalers across the country. 
The memories are so well entrenched in his ageing mind that he snaps back the exact date 
of joining and retiring in a flash.

<h2>About MSK Creations</h2>

<div id="hello">
<p> MSK Creations was established on some date. i dont know. The Mountain View company also 
released the new Android M developer preview, just like how Android Lollipop was released
 as Android L at last year's I/O conference. Similarly, the official name of the new OS
 version will only be revealed at the time of the next Nexus device launch, expected in October.
 Google also stressed that for Android M, the company has focused on improving the core experience 
 of Android and has made some changes to the fundamentals of the platform apart from fixing
 several bugs. During the Google I/O keynote, the company also revealed that this time it will
 provide a clear timeline for Android M Developer Preview for testing and feedback to the preview build.
Here are biggest changes to Android that Google has introduced with Android M.
One of the biggest additions that Android M brings to the Android platform is the 
revamped app permissions. The company, as rumoured previously, announced increased user control 
of app permissions in the M release. Android M also changes existing permissions system by breaking down 
user permissions into specific categories, and having apps ask the user for permission at the time access
 to a feature is required.
